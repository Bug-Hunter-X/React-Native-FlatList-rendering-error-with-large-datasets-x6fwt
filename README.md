This repository contains a demonstration of a common error encountered when using FlatList in React Native to render large datasets. The bug is caused by inefficient data handling within the FlatList component, leading to performance issues and potential crashes. The solution demonstrates how to improve performance by implementing techniques such as optimization of the renderItem function and using the keyExtractor prop effectively.
